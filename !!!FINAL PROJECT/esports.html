        <h2>Yup, it's gamer time.</h2>
        <p>
          I am a very competitive person when it comes to Overwatch. I have been
          playing the game since approximately 2018, and I've been big into the
          competitive mode since. To date, I have 1,096 hours in the competitive
          game mode alone. You can see my rank history from Overwatch 2 on the
          right. Unfortunately, while the data from Overwatch 1 is still used to
          analyze statistics, the competitive history has been cleared for any
          season prior to Overwatch 2.

          In my Senior year of High School, I formed the Shawano High School
          Esports program. At the time, we were only able to play Rocket League
          and League of Legends due to hardware limitations and rules from the
          Wisconsin High School Esports Association (WIHSEA) station all players
          had to play from school. While we didn't place well that year, and
          with COVID happening the following semester, that chapter of my career
          closed almost as quick as it began.
        </p>
        <p>
          After COVID happened, school came to a halt and I was unable to
          compete until I arrived at Michigan Tech. While I didn't make the cut
          originally in Fall, I was brought in during the Spring semester to
          play Main Tank. We only had one major tournament, the Michigan
          Bandwidth Bowl, but we ended with a strong 2nd place, which I'm very
          proud of considering it was an off-role and I had teammates who were
          <i>much</i> better than me at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the nightmare of COVID began to roll away, I transferred to UWSP
          and immediately took an interest in growing the Esports program on
          campus. In my first semester at point, I became Vice-President of our
          campus' Esports program. During that initial year, I helped build a
          foundation for the program to grow. The next fall, Tristan (the
          then-President) had to take a leave and I was promoted to President
          and had a lot of things to manage. After a very long semester, I
          relieved myself from that position and took a less-intense role of
          Production Manager. My current role has me streaming most, but
          preferably all, of our weekly matches for anyone to view. These
          streams happen at
          <a href="https://twitch.tv/uwsp_esports">twitch.tv/uwsp_esports</a>,
          so if you're interested in watching feel free to stop by. We've got
          big plans to remodel the page for Fall!

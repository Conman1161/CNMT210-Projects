            <p>Ella is excited for her first day at a new school.</p>

            <p>
              But her first day doesn't go quite as planned: Her new classmates
              don't like her disco-ball shoes, her PB&J-with-sprinkles sandwich,
              or her rainbow-y unicorn painting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ella decides to try to be less sparkly at school the next day so
              the other kids won't make fun of her. But with a little help from
              her dad, she soon learns the importance of just being herself, no
              matter what other people say.

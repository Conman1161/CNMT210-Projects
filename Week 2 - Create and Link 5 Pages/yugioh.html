        Yu-Gi-Oh! is a Trading Card Game where two players compete to reduce the
        other's life points from 8000 to 0. Cards come pre-packaged in packs of
        9 and it is up to chance which cards you open. You are able to use any
        of the over 10,000 cards that have been created in you deck, unless it
        is part of a special Forbidden and Limited list. Gamers get together
        every weekend to compete against each other, with the winners getting
        various prizes. It's a lot of fun, get your game on!

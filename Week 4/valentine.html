      With this website, I want to express how much I care about my partner.

      Here's a picture that he drew of us just after Valentine's Day last year.
      It's one of my favorite artworks he's done of us, and I use it as the
      picture for most websites I frequently use.

      This Valentine's Day, I want to get him a gift. I'm not sure what he'll
      like the most, but a few things are running through my mind:
    </p>
    <ol class="class2">
      <li>A new mouse</li>
      <dt>The current mouse he's using hasn't been working well</dt>
      <li>A game on Steam</li>
      <dt>
        I've been trying to get him a game called "Lethal Company" since it's on
        sale, but he hasn't accepted it yet
      </dt>
      <li>Quality time together</li>
      <dt>
        Both of us are college students with little-to-no income, so getting him
        something might not be entirely realistic. Spending time with the people
        you love, especially if they're not doing well, can mean a lot
      </dt>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <hr color="white" />
    <br />
    <p class="class1">
      If we spend quality time together, we may end up watching a movie (or
      two). I don't know exactly which one we'd watch, since neither of us
      really care for romance movies, but these are some ideas we might put on:

        Click (2006), Rated PG-13. A workaholic architect finds a universal

      ...that last one might not be a valentine's themed movie, but it would be
      fun to watch.

      We met in the discord server of a musician/DJ (Voia) that we both enjoy.
      Here is his favorite song from that artist.
